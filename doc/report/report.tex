\section{Introduction}

Student--class allocation is a routine problem for educational institutions, and is usually solved as a constrainted resource allocation problem where classes are the resources, the agents are the students and subject to constraints such as a student not having overlapping classes of different subjects and balancing class sizes.
However, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, further constraints must be applied to increase physical distancing and reduce the number of contacts, such as more strongly enforcing class balancing, and also balancing the number of students with even and odd ID number in a class so students with even and odd IDs can have presential classes in alternating weeks.

We will thus model this problem as a constraint optimization problem (COP) with a set of soft and hard constraints, and provide it with a value function that should be optimized.
We encoded the problem as a Prolog program using SICStus Prolog and the constraint logic programming (CLP) module \texttt{clpfd} (\textit{CLP over Finite Domains}), with an interface to solve an instance of the problem.
We then generate a set of different scenarios with varying dimensions to analyse the time complexity of the solution.
Finally we present the results of our experiments.

\section{Problem description}

Consider an educational institution which lectures $|S|$ subjects numbered $s=1, 2, ... , |S|$ ($S = \{1, 2, ..., |S|\}$ is the set of subjects), where subject $s$ has $|C^s|$ classes numbered $c=1, 2, ..., |C^s|$ ($C^s = \{1, 2, ..., |C^s|\}$ is the set of classes of subject $s$).

That institution has a set of students with ID $i$, and for each student it is known his average grade from past school years $0 \leq g^i \leq 20$, the subjects he is enrolled in subjects sequence $S^i = \langle S^i_1, S^i_2, ..., S^i_{|S^i|} \rangle$, $S^i_k \in S$ and his chosen schedule options $O^i = \{o^i_1, o^i_2, ..., o^i_{|S^i|}\}$ where $3 \geq N_i \geq 6$ is the number of schedule options the student chose, and $o^i_j$ is the $j$-th option of student $i$, where an option is $o^i_j = \langle c^i_{j, 1}, c^i_{j, 2}, ..., {c^i_{j, |S_i|}} \rangle$, where $c^i_{j,k}$ is the class student $i$ selected for his/her $j$-th option and subject $S^i_k$.

The solution is, for each student $i$, an empty schedule $a^i=\langle \rangle$ if he/she was not allocated, or the allocated schedule $a^i = \langle a^i_1, a^i_2, ..., a^i_{|S_i|} \rangle$ if he was allocated.

\section{Approach}

\subsection{Data}

The input data is made of:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Facts using the predicate \texttt{schedule(Subject, Class, Time)}, which means class \texttt{Class} of subject \texttt{Subject} is attending a lecture at time \texttt{Time}. To simplify without loss of generality, subjects are numbered sequentially starting in 1, classes of a subject are numbered sequentially starting in 1, and time is an integer representing a time slot (for instance, time can be divided into $\SI{30}{\minute}$ slots where the first slot is on Monday from 00:00 to 00:30). This representation of time is merely a convenient way to understand time, as the only thing that matters is the boolean relation that states if two subject-class pairs overlap.
    \item Facts using the predicate \texttt{student(ID, Order, Subject, Class)}, which means student with ID \texttt{ID} has chosen class \texttt{Class} of subject \texttt{Subject} as its \texttt{Order}-th choice. \texttt{Order} is numbered sequentially and each student must have between 3 and 6 schedule options (inclusive).
    \item Facts using the predicate \texttt{grade(ID, Grade)}, which means student with ID \texttt{ID} has average grade \texttt{Grade}.
    \item Facts using the predicate \texttt{student(ID, Grade, Subjects, Options)}, which means student with ID \texttt{ID} has average grade \texttt{Grade} is enrolled in the subjects \texttt{Subjects} which is a list, and has chosen the options  \texttt{Options} which is a list of 3 to 6 schedule options, with each element being a list of the same size as \texttt{Subjects} containing the classes chosen for the respective option.
\end{enumerate}

For each ID in \texttt{student}, there should be a fact \texttt{grade} reporting the grade of that student.

\subsection{Decision variables}

For each student and for each subject that student is enrolled, his class is outputted. The domain of the class is the set of classes a subject has as stated in facts using predicate \texttt{schedule}.

\subsection{Constraints}

\subsubsection{Hard constraints}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Students are placed in decreasing order of their grades.
    \item A student is either completely allocated to one of his/her chosen schedules, or not allocated at all (\textit{optional}: a student can be allocated another schedule different from any of the student's choices).
    \item (\textit{Optional}) A student does not have overlapping classes in his/her allocated schedule.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Soft constraints}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The number of students per class in a given subject is balanced.
    \item The number of students of even and odd number in a given class-subject is balanced.
    \item (\textit{Optional}) Students should be allocated to their preferred schedules by order, where the first schedule option is the student's preferred and the last one the least preferred.
\end{enumerate}
